======

Wouldn't you love to edit/create confluence pages through sublime without having to open a browser? 

Status
------
Still in pre-alpha development. This section will be removed when the package is ready for use.


Installation
-----------
This project isn't yet hosted on package control, so it has to be installed manually (for now). To install this package, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bprinty/sublime-confluence.git
```

into your sublime ```Packages/``` folder.
